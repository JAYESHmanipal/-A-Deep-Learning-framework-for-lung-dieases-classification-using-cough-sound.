The project aims to diagnose pulmonary diseases by analyzing respiratory sounds using
advanced AI technologies, including machine learning and deep learning techniques .
 Responsibilities:
* Audio feature extraction
 * Handle imbalanced data
* Perform multimodel Deep learning approach (ResNet50, EfficientNet, Bi-GRU + AttentionLayer + XGBoost).




Dataset:

The project uses the ICBHI 2017 Dataset, consisting of 920 audio samples from 126 subjects, all annotated by medical experts. This dataset is notable for being one of the largest publicly available databases in the field of respiratory diseases.
